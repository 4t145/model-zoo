# Flux Model Zoo

This repository contains various demonstrations of the [Flux](http://fluxml.github.io/) machine learning library. Any of these may freely be used as a starting point for your own models.

- **housing** implements the most basic model possible (a linear regression) on the [UCI housing data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). It's bare-bones and illustrates how to build a model from scratch.
- **mnist** classifies digits from the [MNIST data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), using a simple multi-layer perceptron.
- **char-rnn** implements a [character-level language model](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). It comes with a Shakespeare dataset but can work with any text.
